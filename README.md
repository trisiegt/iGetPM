# What is iGet?
iGet (pronounced eye-get) is a simple package manager for the Microsoft Windows operating system, similar to Winget, but written in the Batch (.bat, .cmd) programming language.
It's creator, Tristan Carpenter is fine with people creating so-called "forks" of this project, as described in the LICENSE file.

# How to install
To install iGet, download the setup file and the registry file under the Releases tab.
Then, open the installer (exe) file.
Just spam-click "Next" until the end screen.
Uncheck "Run iGet Package Manager", because we aren't finished with the installation process.
Next, open the .reg file.
The registry editor will come up with a warning asking if you want to install the hive since it may be malicious.

The message looks similar to this.
Don't worry though, there's no malware on this repository.
After the hive has finished installing, click OK.
Eureka! iGet is installed!
